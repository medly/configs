# Contribution Guide
This page contains guidelines for contributing to the this project. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Pull Requests
The pull request process differs for new features and bugs. Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied. Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature.

Pull requests for bugs may be sent without creating any proposal issue. If you believe that you know of a solution for a bug that has been filed on GitHub, please leave a comment detailing your proposed fix.
